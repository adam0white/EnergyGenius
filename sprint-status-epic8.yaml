# Epic 8 Notes:
# ==============
# CRITICAL PRODUCTION BUG FIXES - All P0 and P1 severity
#
# Background: Epic 7 deployed successfully but post-deployment reveals critical
# issues affecting user experience and system functionality.
#
# Four critical bugs identified and prioritized:
# 1. Story 8.1 (P0): Validation too strict - rejects valid plan variations
#    Impact: AI recommendations fail, fall back to $0 costs (system unusable)
#
# 2. Story 8.2 (P0): $0 costs showing in fallback
#    Impact: Users cannot make decisions, system broken in production
#
# 3. Story 8.3 (P2): Progress duration shows "0s" when complete
#    Impact: Minor UX issue but confusing to users
#
# 4. Story 8.4 (P1): Verify scraper working & plan data availability
#    Impact: If scraper broken, limited plan options reduce recommendation quality
#
# Recommended Execution Order:
# Phase 1 (Immediate - P0):
#   1. 8.4 - Verify scraper and plan data (determines if other fixes needed)
#   2. 8.1 - Fix validation (allows recommendations to work)
#   3. 8.2 - Fix $0 costs (makes fallback useful)
#
# Phase 2 (Follow-up - P2):
#   4. 8.3 - Fix progress duration (cosmetic, lower priority)
#
# Dependencies:
# - 8.1 and 8.2 are related (both affect recommendation quality)
# - 8.4 results may affect priorities
# - 8.3 is independent
#
# Timeline Estimate:
# 8.4: 1 day (verify/fix scraper, check data)
# 8.1: 2 days (understand validation, implement fuzzy matching, test)
# 8.2: 1-2 days (debug fallback, fix costs, test)
# 8.3: 0.5-1 day (identify issue, fix, test)
# Total: 4-6 days for full epic

# Scraper Status Notes:
# Story 7.7 implemented web scraper for powertochoose.org.
# Story 8.4 will verify it's working and we have ~100 plans in catalog.
# If scraper is broken, must fix to get sufficient plan data.

# Validation Status Notes:
# Story 7.8 implemented strict 3-stage validation to prevent hallucinations.
# This was correct design, but TOO strict for real-world variations.
# Story 8.1 will relax planName validation while keeping supplier/planId strict.

# Cost Display Status Notes:
# Story 8.1 failure causes fallback, which doesn't include cost data.
# Story 8.2 fixes fallback to always show real costs (not $0).
# Together they should make system functional again.
