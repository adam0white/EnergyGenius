**Epic:** Epic 10 - Critical Production Bugs
**Status:** Done
**Priority:** P1 - High (Testing & Demo Experience)
**Complexity:** Medium
**Owner:** Dev Team
**Agent Model Used:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
**QA Status:** PASS - Final Approval

## User Story

As a developer testing the EnergyGenius platform, I need expanded mock data with higher current rates so that I can demonstrate meaningful savings across different tier levels (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and validate the recommendation engine with diverse customer profiles.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current Limitations:**

1. **Limited Variety:** Only 5 usage scenarios available for testing
   - Repetitive testing experience
   - Limited coverage of customer profiles
   - Missing edge cases (very high usage, very low usage, medium business)

2. **Current Rates Too Competitive:** Base rates of 0.11-0.13 $/kWh are too good
   - Most catalog plans range 0.08-0.18 $/kWh
   - Hard to find plans that beat current rates
   - Demonstrations mostly show Bronze tier (<$500 savings)
   - Difficult to showcase Gold/Silver tier recommendations ($500-2000 savings)

3. **Poor Savings Demonstration:**
   - User testing shows mostly Bronze tier results
   - Value proposition unclear when savings are minimal
   - Gold/Silver tiers underutilized
   - Hard to demonstrate platform value

**Business Impact:**
- Weak demonstration of value proposition
- Testing coverage gaps
- User onboarding experience shows minimal savings
- Platform capabilities underrepresented

---

## Background & Context

**Current Mock Data System:**

**File:** `src/worker/data/usage-scenarios.ts`
- Contains 5 usage scenarios with 12 months of realistic data
- Scenarios: Average Household, High Summer, Low Efficient, Small Business, Winter-Heavy
- Annual usage ranges: 6,000 - 26,000 kWh/year

**File:** `src/ui/hooks/useAutofillMockData.ts`
- Maps scenarios to form data structure
- Generates current plan details with base rates
- Applies 5-10% random variance for realism
- Current base rates (lines 156-160):
  - residential: 0.12 $/kWh
  - small-business: 0.11 $/kWh
  - seasonal-high: 0.13 $/kWh
  - seasonal-low: 0.115 $/kWh

**Catalog Plan Range:**
- Scraped plans from powertochoose.org
- Rate range: ~0.08 - 0.18 $/kWh
- Many competitive plans at 0.09-0.13 $/kWh

**Problem:** Current rates (0.11-0.13) overlap heavily with catalog plan rates, making it hard to find significant savings.

**Desired State:**
- 7 total usage scenarios (adding 2-3 new profiles)
- Higher base current rates (0.14-0.17 range)
- Diverse customer profiles covering wide usage ranges
- Recommendations showing Gold/Silver tiers more frequently
- Better demonstration of platform value

---

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Add New Usage Scenarios (2-3 profiles)

**New Scenario Options:**

**Option A: Large Family Home**
- Type: `large-family` (new type)
- Annual Usage: 18,000-20,000 kWh/year
- Description: 4-bedroom suburban home, large family, multiple HVAC zones
- Seasonal Pattern: High summer (AC) and moderate winter (electric heating)
- Target Current Rate: 0.17 $/kWh (expensive legacy plan)

**Option B: Apartment Dweller**
- Type: `apartment` (new type)
- Annual Usage: 4,000-5,000 kWh/year
- Description: 1-bedroom efficient apartment, minimal heating/cooling
- Seasonal Pattern: Very low, slight peaks in summer
- Target Current Rate: 0.14 $/kWh (reasonable but improvable)

**Option C: Medium Business**
- Type: `medium-business` (new type)
- Annual Usage: 40,000-50,000 kWh/year
- Description: Small office building with HVAC, servers, lighting
- Seasonal Pattern: Consistent usage with summer peaks
- Target Current Rate: 0.16 $/kWh (high business rate)

**Selection:** Implement ALL THREE to reach 8 total scenarios (exceeds minimum 7)

### Phase 2: Adjust Current Rates for Better Savings Demos

**Current Rates (TOO LOW):**
```typescript
residential: 0.12,           // Hard to beat
'small-business': 0.11,      // Very competitive
'seasonal-high': 0.13,       // Only slightly high
'seasonal-low': 0.115,       // Too good
```

**Proposed Rates (HIGHER for demos):**
```typescript
residential: 0.155,          // 15.5 cents - enables $500-1000+ savings
'small-business': 0.145,     // 14.5 cents - competitive but improvable
'seasonal-high': 0.165,      // 16.5 cents - poor rate, big savings potential
'seasonal-low': 0.15,        // 15 cents - average rate
'large-family': 0.17,        // NEW: 17 cents - expensive legacy plan
'apartment': 0.14,           // NEW: 14 cents - reasonable but can improve
'medium-business': 0.16,     // NEW: 16 cents - high business rate
```

**Rationale:**
- Catalog plans range 0.08-0.18 $/kWh
- Setting current rates to 0.14-0.17 allows catalog plans at 0.09-0.13 to show $500-2000 annual savings
- Demonstrates Gold/Silver tiers (≥$500, ≥$1000 savings) more frequently
- Realistic: Many users ARE on expensive plans (legacy contracts, default utility rates)
- Better value proposition demonstration

---

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Strategy

**Step 1: Create New Scenarios**
- Design 12 months of realistic usage data for each new scenario
- Ensure seasonal variations are realistic
- Calculate totals accurately

**Step 2: Update Rate Structures**
- Adjust all base rates upward (0.14-0.17 range)
- Add new scenario type mappings
- Maintain consistency across rate, fee, and preference mappings

**Step 3: Test Thoroughly**
- Test each new scenario individually
- Verify existing scenarios still work
- Validate savings tier distribution improves

**Step 4: Document Changes**
- Update all relevant comments
- Document rationale for rate increases
- Update scenario counts and descriptions

### Rate Adjustment Rationale

**Why Higher Rates?**

Current rates (0.11-0.13 $/kWh) are competitive with many catalog plans (0.08-0.18 range). This makes it difficult to demonstrate significant savings because:

1. **Overlap with Catalog:** Many good plans fall in 0.09-0.13 range
2. **Limited Savings Potential:** With current rate at 0.12, a 0.10 plan only saves $200-400/year for average usage
3. **Bronze Tier Dominance:** Most recommendations show <$500 savings (Bronze tier)
4. **Weak Value Proposition:** Hard to demonstrate why users should switch

**New Rates (0.14-0.17 $/kWh) Enable:**

1. **Significant Savings:** 0.09-0.11 plans now save $500-2000+ annually
2. **Gold/Silver Tiers:** More recommendations qualify for higher tiers
3. **Realistic Scenarios:** Many users ARE on expensive legacy plans
4. **Better Demos:** Clearer value proposition in testing/onboarding

**Example Calculation:**
- Large Family Home: 19,200 kWh/year at 0.17 $/kWh = $3,264/year
- Switch to plan at 0.10 $/kWh = $1,920/year
- Annual Savings: $1,344 (Gold Tier)

### Seasonal Pattern Guidelines

**Large Family Home (4-bed suburban):**
- Winter: Moderate heating (1,400-1,600 kWh)
- Spring/Fall: Mild usage (1,200-1,400 kWh)
- Summer: High AC usage (1,800-2,000 kWh)
- Pattern: Summer peak, winter secondary peak

**Apartment Dweller (1-bed efficient):**
- Winter: Low heating (350-400 kWh)
- Spring/Fall: Minimal usage (300-350 kWh)
- Summer: Moderate AC (450-500 kWh)
- Pattern: Flat with slight summer bump

**Medium Business (office building):**
- Winter: HVAC + base load (3,500-4,000 kWh)
- Spring/Fall: Base load + mild HVAC (3,800-4,200 kWh)
- Summer: HVAC peak + base load (4,500-5,000 kWh)
- Pattern: Consistent high usage with summer peak

### Files to Modify

1. **`src/worker/data/usage-scenarios.ts`**
   - Add 3 new scenario objects to array
   - Update header comment (5 → 8 scenarios)

2. **`src/ui/hooks/useAutofillMockData.ts`**
   - Update `baseRates` object (lines 155-160)
   - Update `monthlyFees` object (lines 162-167)
   - Update `preferenceProfiles` in `generatePreferences` function

### Math Fix Verification - RESOLVED

#### Large Family Home Math Error - FIXED

**Location:** `src/worker/data/usage-scenarios.ts` lines 141-156

**Previous Issue:** Monthly usage values summed to 18,700 kWh but documented annualKWh was 19,200 kWh (500 kWh discrepancy).

**Fix Applied:** Added 50 kWh to each of the first 10 months (Jan-Oct)

**Corrected Values:**
```typescript
monthlyUsage: [
  { month: 1, kWh: 1550 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 2, kWh: 1450 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 3, kWh: 1350 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 4, kWh: 1250 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 5, kWh: 1450 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 6, kWh: 1850 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 7, kWh: 2050 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 8, kWh: 1950 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 9, kWh: 1750 },  // +50 ✅
  { month: 10, kWh: 1450 }, // +50 ✅
  { month: 11, kWh: 1500 }, // unchanged
  { month: 12, kWh: 1600 }, // unchanged
],
annualKWh: 19200,  // ✅ CORRECT (sum verified)
averageMonthlyKWh: 1600,  // ✅ CORRECT (19200/12)
```

**Verification Results:**
- Sum of monthly values: **19,200 kWh** (EXACT MATCH)
- Average monthly usage: **1,600 kWh** (19,200 ÷ 12)
- Seasonal pattern: **PRESERVED** (summer peak, winter moderate, spring/fall mild)
- Build validation: **PASSED** (npm run build successful in 1.31s)

**Impact:** RESOLVED - All calculations now mathematically accurate.
