## User Story

As a user, I should see the correct elapsed time when a recommendation request completes. Currently the progress shows elapsed time correctly while running, but once complete it displays "Duration 0s" instead of showing the total time taken. This is a minor UX issue that confuses users about how long the request took.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Investigate Progress Duration Issue

- [ ] Understand current progress display:
  - [ ] Review ProgressTimeline component code
  - [ ] Understand how duration is calculated
  - [ ] Check what happens when status changes to "complete"
  - [ ] Identify where "Duration 0s" is coming from
- [ ] Test the progress display:
  - [ ] Generate a recommendation request
  - [ ] Watch progress timeline while running
  - [ ] Check what's displayed while running
  - [ ] Check what's displayed when complete
  - [ ] Manually verify how long it actually took
- [ ] Check the data flow:
  - [ ] What data is passed to ProgressTimeline?
  - [ ] How is duration calculated from start/end times?
  - [ ] When is the status changed to complete?
  - [ ] Is duration recalculated after completion?
- [ ] Trace the timer logic:
  - [ ] How is the timer started?
  - [ ] How is it updated while running?
  - [ ] What happens when request completes?
  - [ ] Is there a race condition in timing?
- [ ] Developer has full authority to investigate without restrictions

### 2. Identify Root Cause of Duration Display

Possible causes to investigate:
- [ ] **Duration State Not Updated**: Component uses state for duration
  - [ ] Check if duration state is updated on completion
  - [ ] Verify state change triggers re-render
  - [ ] Check for stale closure capturing old duration
- [ ] **Race Condition**: Duration calculation happens before endTime is set
  - [ ] Check timing of state updates
  - [ ] Verify endTime is set before duration calc
  - [ ] Look for timing dependencies
- [ ] **Incorrect Duration Calculation**: Formula is wrong
  - [ ] Check if calculation uses correct timestamps
  - [ ] Verify math is correct (endTime - startTime)
  - [ ] Check for unit conversion issues (ms vs seconds)
- [ ] **Display Logic Issue**: Calculation correct but display is wrong
  - [ ] Check if duration is displayed before being set
  - [ ] Look for conditional rendering
  - [ ] Check for fallback display value
- [ ] **Status Change Side Effect**: Something resets duration when status changes
  - [ ] Check useEffect dependencies
  - [ ] Look for state resets on status change
  - [ ] Verify state cleanup logic
- [ ] **Timing Mismatch**: Frontend duration doesn't match request duration
  - [ ] Check if frontend timer matches server time
  - [ ] Verify no clock skew issues
  - [ ] Check if duration is from frontend or backend

### 3. Fix Duration Calculation and Display

Implement fix based on root cause:

- [ ] **If Duration Not Updated**:
  - [ ] Add state update for duration on completion
  - [ ] Ensure state update happens after endTime is set
  - [ ] Verify component re-renders with new duration
  - [ ] Test that duration displays correctly

- [ ] **If Race Condition**:
  - [ ] Ensure proper dependency ordering
  - [ ] Use useEffect to calculate duration when status changes
  - [ ] Verify endTime is available before calculation
  - [ ] Test timing under various conditions

- [ ] **If Calculation Wrong**:
  - [ ] Fix duration formula
  - [ ] Ensure correct unit handling (ms vs seconds)
  - [ ] Verify calculation matches actual elapsed time
  - [ ] Add unit tests for calculation

- [ ] **If Display Issue**:
  - [ ] Update display logic to show current duration value
  - [ ] Ensure display uses correct state variable
  - [ ] Add fallback for missing duration
  - [ ] Test display renders correctly

- [ ] **If Status Change Side Effect**:
  - [ ] Check and fix useEffect dependencies
  - [ ] Ensure state isn't reset on status change
  - [ ] Verify cleanup logic doesn't affect duration
  - [ ] Test that previous duration is preserved

### 4. Test Progress Duration Display

- [ ] Unit tests:
  - [ ] Test duration calculation with various times
  - [ ] Test state updates on status change
  - [ ] Test display formatting
  - [ ] Test edge cases (0 duration, very long, etc.)
- [ ] Component tests:
  - [ ] Test ProgressTimeline with mock data
  - [ ] Verify duration displays correctly
  - [ ] Test status transitions
  - [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Integration tests:
  - [ ] Generate recommendations
  - [ ] Verify progress shows correct duration while running
  - [ ] Verify completion shows total elapsed time
  - [ ] Test with various request lengths
- [ ] Manual testing:
  - [ ] Generate short requests (test immediate completion)
  - [ ] Generate long requests (test extended progress)
  - [ ] Verify duration is accurate
  - [ ] Check formatting is consistent

### 5. Verify No Regressions

- [ ] Progress timeline still works while running:
  - [ ] Timer updates while request is in progress
  - [ ] Duration increases smoothly
  - [ ] No flickering or jumps in duration
- [ ] Progress timeline works on completion:
  - [ ] Final duration displays correctly
  - [ ] Status changes to complete properly
  - [ ] No errors when request finishes
- [ ] Other progress features unaffected:
  - [ ] Progress bars still animate
  - [ ] Status messages still display
  - [ ] Completion callbacks still fire
  - [ ] All other components still work

### 6. Validation & Commit

- [ ] Final verification:
  - [ ] Generate recommendations and verify duration
  - [ ] Check multiple requests
  - [ ] Verify formatting is consistent
  - [ ] Run all tests and verify passing
- [ ] Update documentation if needed:
  - [ ] Document ProgressTimeline duration behavior
  - [ ] Add comments to duration calculation
  - [ ] Update dev notes if logic changed

## Dev Notes

### Investigation Authority

Developer has full authority to:
- Modify ProgressTimeline component
- Change duration calculation logic
- Update state management for progress
- Modify or add tests
- Investigate timing logic
- Refactor component structure if needed

### Key Files to Investigate

- Progress component: `/src/ui/components/progress/ProgressTimeline.tsx` or similar
- Progress state/context: Look for progress state management
- Tests: `/test/ProgressTimeline.spec.ts` or similar
- Styles: Check Tailwind classes for display issues

### Debug Approach

1. **Verify the Issue**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   # Generate a recommendation
   # Watch the progress display
   # When complete, check what it shows
   # Note: Should show elapsed time, not 0s
   ```

2. **Add Debug Logging**:
   - Log startTime when request begins
   - Log endTime when request completes
   - Log duration calculation
   - Log what's displayed

3. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - Quick requests (1-2 seconds)
   - Longer requests (30+ seconds)
   - Very long requests (60+ seconds)
   - Verify duration is accurate in each case

4. **Check Component State**:
   - Use React DevTools to inspect component state
   - Verify duration state value
   - Check if state updates on completion
   - Look for stale closures

### Common Issues

1. **Stale Closure**: Function captures old duration value
   - Solution: Use useCallback or update state properly

2. **Race Condition**: Duration calculated before endTime set
   - Solution: Ensure dependency ordering in useEffect

3. **State Not Updating**: useEffect not triggering
   - Solution: Check dependencies, ensure status change triggers update

4. **Display Bug**: Calculation correct but display wrong
   - Solution: Check rendered value vs state value

### Duration Format

Current format appears to be "Duration Xs" where X is seconds.
Examples:
- "Duration 5s" (5 seconds)
- "Duration 45s" (45 seconds)
- "Duration 0s" (BUG - should be actual duration)

Verify this format is maintained in fix.

### Expected Outcome

After this story:
- Progress shows correct elapsed time while running
- On completion, shows total elapsed time (not 0s)
- Duration format is consistent
- No console errors or warnings
- User experience improved (clear feedback on request time)

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5

### Debug Log

**Root Cause Identified:**
The `PipelineStage` interface only had ONE `timestamp` field that was used for both start time and end time. When a stage started, `timestamp` was set to the start time. When a stage completed, the `COMPLETE_PIPELINE_STAGE` reducer did NOT update the timestamp field, leaving it as the start time. The `useRecommendation.ts` hook then incorrectly used the same timestamp for both `startTime` and `endTime` (lines 346-347, 353-354, 360-361), causing `endTime - startTime = 0`, resulting in "Duration 0s".

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added `endTime` field to `PipelineStage` interface in `types.ts`
2. Updated initial state in `RecommendationContext.tsx` to include `endTime: null`
3. Updated `START_PIPELINE_STAGE` reducer to set `endTime: null` when stage starts
4. Updated `COMPLETE_PIPELINE_STAGE` reducer to set `endTime: new Date()` when stage completes
5. Updated `useRecommendation.ts` to use separate `endTime` field instead of reusing `timestamp`
6. Created comprehensive unit tests in `test/progress-duration.spec.ts` to prevent regression

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/context/types.ts` - Added `endTime` field to PipelineStage interface
- `src/ui/context/RecommendationContext.tsx` - Updated reducers to track endTime
- `src/ui/hooks/useRecommendation.ts` - Use endTime field for completed stages
- `test/progress-duration.spec.ts` - Added 12 tests including regression tests

**Testing:**
- All 12 new unit tests pass
- TypeScript compilation successful
- No regressions in existing test suite (150 tests still pass)
- Build successful

### Completion Notes

Fixed the progress duration display bug by adding a separate `endTime` field to track when stages complete. The original implementation only had one timestamp field that was reused for both start and end times, causing the duration calculation to always be 0 when a stage completed. Now each stage tracks both `timestamp` (start time) and `endTime` (completion time), allowing accurate duration calculation.

## Change Log

### 2025-11-11 - Story 8.3 Created: Fix Progress Duration Display - Show Correct Elapsed Time

**Problem**: Progress timeline shows "Duration 0s" when request completes, instead of showing the total elapsed time that was being counted correctly before completion.

**Root Cause**: The `PipelineStage` interface only had one `timestamp` field used for both start and end times. When stages completed, the `COMPLETE_PIPELINE_STAGE` reducer didn't update the timestamp, so `useRecommendation.ts` incorrectly used the same timestamp for both `startTime` and `endTime`, resulting in 0s duration.

**Solution**: Added separate `endTime` field to `PipelineStage` interface. Updated reducers to set `endTime: new Date()` when stages complete. Updated `useRecommendation.ts` to use the `endTime` field for completed stages instead of reusing `timestamp`.

**Impact**:
- Users see actual request time instead of confusing "0s"
- Better UX feedback on system performance
- Minor cosmetic improvement but important for clarity
- Added 12 unit tests to prevent regression

### 2025-11-11 - Story 8.3 Completed: Fix Implemented and Tested

3. Modified `src/ui/hooks/useRecommendation.ts` - Use separate `endTime` field for completed stages
4. Created `test/progress-duration.spec.ts` - Added comprehensive unit tests (12 tests, all passing)

**Testing Results:**
- All 12 new unit tests pass
- TypeScript compilation successful
- No regressions (150 existing tests still pass)
- Build successful

**Status:** Ready for Review

## QA Results

**Gate Decision:** PASS - APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION

**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)
**Confidence Level:** 99%
**Risk Level:** MINIMAL

### Summary

Story 8.3 successfully resolves the progress duration display bug where completed recommendation requests displayed "Duration 0s" instead of actual elapsed time. The implementation adds a separate endTime field to PipelineStage, correctly updates duration calculations, and includes 12 comprehensive unit tests (all passing) with zero regressions. This is a high-quality, low-risk fix that improves user experience clarity.

### Critical Findings - ALL VERIFIED

- **Duration Calculation Logic:** Correctly uses separate timestamp and endTime fields
- **State Management:** Reducers properly set endTime on stage completion
- **Hook Integration:** useRecommendation.ts correctly passes endTime to component
- **Display Rendering:** ProgressTimeline component displays duration correctly (line 158)
- **Test Coverage:** 12 focused tests all passing, comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Requirements Traceability:** All 6 acceptance criteria fully met
- **No Regressions:** 162/162 tests passing (100% pass rate)

### Test Results

- **Unit Tests Passed:** 12/12 (100%)
- **Total Test Suite:** 162/162 passing
- **Build Status:** SUCCESS
- **TypeScript Compilation:** SUCCESS
- **Regression Check:** NONE FOUND

### Root Cause Analysis - VERIFIED

The bug was correctly identified and fixed:
- **Original Issue:** PipelineStage had single timestamp field used for both start/end
- **Problem:** COMPLETE_PIPELINE_STAGE reducer didn't update timestamp on completion
- **Result:** endTime - startTime = 0, displaying "Duration 0s"
- **Solution:** Added separate endTime field, updated reducers to set it properly

### Solution Quality - EXCELLENT

The implementation is elegant and minimal:
1. Added endTime: Date | null to PipelineStage interface
2. Updated initial state to include endTime: null
3. Updated START_PIPELINE_STAGE reducer to set endTime: null
4. Updated COMPLETE_PIPELINE_STAGE reducer to set endTime: new Date()
5. Updated useRecommendation.ts to use endTime field

Maintains backward compatibility while solving root cause completely.

### Component Integration - VERIFIED

ProgressTimeline component correctly:
- Uses formatDuration(stage.startTime, stage.endTime) for completed stages
- Uses formatDuration(stage.startTime, null) for running stages
- Handles null values safely with fallback to current time
- Updates display every second for running stages
- Shows correct duration on completion

### Edge Cases - ALL HANDLED

- **Instant Completion (0s):** Displays "0s" correctly (not confused with bug)
- **Fast Completion (sub-second):** Millisecond differences formatted correctly
- **Long Duration:** Minutes/seconds format displays correctly
- **Running Stages:** Uses current time fallback when endTime is null
- **Null Handling:** Safe defaults throughout

### Risk Assessment

- **Technical Risk:** MINIMAL - Isolated to type definition and three reducers
- **Data Risk:** NONE - endTime is optional, no data migration required
- **Deployment Risk:** LOW - Additive change, no breaking changes
- **User Impact:** POSITIVE - Users see correct elapsed time
- **Performance Impact:** NONE - No additional API calls or complex calculations
