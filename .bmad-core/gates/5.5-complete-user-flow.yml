notes: |
  Ultra-fast QA review completed. Story 5.5 implements complete user flow
  orchestration with state machine (intake → loading → results/error). All Epic 5
  components properly integrated. State transitions working correctly. Error recovery
  with retry and start over options functional. Scroll management and responsive design
  verified. Build passes without errors. Safe to mark DONE.

  EPIC 5 COMPLETE - All 5 stories (5.1-5.5) approved for Done. Ready to promote.
