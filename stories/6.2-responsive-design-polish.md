## User Story

As a designer, I need to validate and optimize the responsive layout across mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1920px) viewports, so that the application provides an excellent user experience on all device sizes.

- [ ] Form renders with balanced white space
- [ ] ProgressTimeline displayed with optimized spacing
- [ ] Timeline stages clearly visible with proper alignment

- [ ] Header optimized for desktop (title, navigation, branding)
- [ ] Footer optimized for desktop (full step indicator, secondary nav)
- [ ] Content centered with max-width constraint (1200px recommended)

### Typography & Readability

- [ ] Base font size: 16px minimum on mobile
- [ ] Heading sizes scale appropriately for viewport
- [ ] Line height: 1.5+ for body text (readable)
- [ ] Form labels: clear and associated with inputs
- [ ] Error messages: visible and readable at all sizes
- [ ] Recommendation titles: large enough to scan (20px+ mobile)
- [ ] Recommendation descriptions: readable without magnification
- [ ] No text truncation except where intentional

### Touch Targets & Interaction

- [ ] All buttons minimum 44px height (iOS standard)
- [ ] All buttons minimum 44px width (mobile touch size)
- [ ] Form inputs: 44px+ height (form label included)

### Responsive CSS & Viewport

- [ ] Viewport meta tag present: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

## Implementation Details

### Testing Approach

1. Use browser DevTools device emulation (Chrome/Safari)
2. Test at exact viewport sizes: 375px, 768px, 1920px
3. Test on real devices (iPhone, iPad, Android phone if available)
4. Use Lighthouse to check responsive design best practices
5. Document any issues in testing-notes.md

### Responsive Framework

- Tailwind CSS breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Mobile-first CSS strategy: base styles for mobile, then add media queries
- CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layouts
- max-width constraints for readability on ultra-wide screens

### Device Testing

- **Mobile:** iPhone SE (375px width, 667px height)
- **Tablet:** iPad Air (768px width, 1024px height)
- **Desktop:** 1920px width (standard HD monitor)
- **Optional:** Test at intermediate sizes (480px, 600px, 1200px)
