summary: |
  Story 8.2 successfully resolves a critical production bug where fallback recommendations
  displayed $0/month with $0 annual savings. The implementation uses the identical cost
  calculation formula as AI scoring, includes 17 comprehensive tests (all passing), and
  introduces no regressions. The fix enables users to make informed decisions even when
  the AI scoring pipeline fails.
