## User Story

As a user, I want the "Why" explanation for recommendations to be clearly formatted and easy to read, so that I can quickly understand the reasoning behind each recommendation without overwhelming text blocks.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Analyze Current "Why" Section

- [ ] Examine current recommendation response parsing in `/src/worker/ai/response-parsing.ts`
- [ ] Identify how "Why" sections are currently extracted from Claude response
- [ ] Review recommendation card component in `/src/ui/components/RecommendationCard.tsx`
- [ ] Determine current rendering method (single text block vs. formatted)
- [ ] Document findings in dev notes

### Parse "Why" Section Structure

- [ ] Create parser to identify natural structure in "Why" explanations:
  - [ ] Multi-paragraph sections (split by double line breaks)
  - [ ] Bullet point indicators (dash, asterisk, numbered)
  - [ ] Key insights or highlights (bold text patterns)
  - [ ] Impact statements or estimates
- [ ] Handle various Claude response formats:
  - [ ] Some explanations use numbered lists
  - [ ] Some use bullet points
  - [ ] Some use paragraph + nested explanation
  - [ ] Some are plain prose with implicit sections
- [ ] Create robust parser that doesn't break on edge cases
- [ ] Add parser function to `/src/worker/ai/response-parsing.ts`
- [ ] Unit test parser with 10+ example explanations

### Format & Present "Why" Section

- [ ] Design improved visual formatting:
  - [ ] Break text blocks into readable paragraphs
  - [ ] Convert bullet points to visual list items
  - [ ] Highlight key metrics or percentages
  - [ ] Use consistent spacing and indentation
  - [ ] Keep color scheme within existing design (Tailwind/shadcn)
- [ ] Update RecommendationCard component to:
  - [ ] Parse "Why" section using new parser
  - [ ] Render with improved formatting (not just text blob)
  - [ ] Display as styled list/paragraph sections if parsed
  - [ ] Fall back to text block if parsing fails
  - [ ] Maintain responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Ensure formatting works with various explanation lengths:
  - [ ] Short explanations (1-2 sentences)
  - [ ] Medium explanations (paragraph + insights)
  - [ ] Long explanations (multiple structured sections)

### Visual Design & Testing

- [ ] Create visual mockups of improved formatting:
  - [ ] How will bullets be styled?
  - [ ] How will paragraphs be spaced?
  - [ ] How will key metrics be highlighted?
  - [ ] Ensure Tailwind consistency
- [ ] Test with real recommendation responses:
  - [ ] Run app with sample recommendations
  - [ ] Verify "Why" sections render correctly
  - [ ] Test on desktop, tablet, mobile views
  - [ ] Check contrast and readability
  - [ ] Ensure no overflow or layout issues
- [ ] Get visual approval (compare before/after)
- [ ] Verify no accessibility regressions:
  - [ ] Color contrast passes WCAG AA
  - [ ] Semantic HTML for lists
  - [ ] Proper heading hierarchy if using headers

### Code & Documentation

- [ ] Add parser function to `/src/worker/ai/response-parsing.ts`:
  - [ ] Function to parse structured "Why" text
  - [ ] Return structured data (paragraphs, lists, metrics)
  - [ ] Thorough JSDoc comments
  - [ ] Error handling for malformed input
- [ ] Update `/src/ui/components/RecommendationCard.tsx`:
  - [ ] Import and use new parser
  - [ ] Render improved "Why" section format
  - [ ] Add TypeScript types for parsed structure
  - [ ] Add Tailwind classes for styling
  - [ ] Maintain responsive behavior
- [ ] Update `/src/ui/components/RecommendationCard.tsx` styles:
  - [ ] Add Tailwind utility classes
  - [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
  - [ ] Test with Tailwind's responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Update `/docs/architecture.md`:
  - [ ] Document "Why" section parsing strategy
  - [ ] Include examples of formatted output
  - [ ] Note any limitations or edge cases
- [ ] Commit with message: "Improve 'Why' section formatting in recommendations"

## Dev Notes

- Current implementation likely renders the entire "Why" text as a single block
- Many Claude responses naturally structure explanations with line breaks and indicators
- Goal: Parse this natural structure and present it visually without breaking responsiveness
- The parser should be robust enough to handle multiple response formats from Claude
- Consider: Should we format on the worker (backend) or client (React component)?
  - Recommendation: Format on client for flexibility, but structure data on worker

### Project Structure Notes

- Response parsing: `/src/worker/ai/response-parsing.ts` [Source: story-5.3]
- Recommendation card: `/src/ui/components/RecommendationCard.tsx` [Source: story-5.3]
- Tailwind styling: Configured in `tailwind.config.js`
- Component styling approach: shadcn components with Tailwind

Claude Sonnet 4.5

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Parser Created** (`narrative-parser.ts`):
   - Identifies natural text structure: paragraphs, bullet lists, numbered lists, metrics
   - Detects metric sections with dollar amounts, percentages, kWh values
   - Handles multiple narrative formats from Claude responses
   - Robust parsing with fallback to plain text
   - Comprehensive test coverage: 16 test cases covering edge cases

2. **UI Components Added** (`RecommendationDeck.tsx`):
   - `FormattedNarrative`: Main component that parses and renders text
   - `NarrativeSectionRenderer`: Renders individual sections with type-specific styling
   - Bullet lists: Blue bullet points with proper spacing
   - Metrics: Highlighted in blue-50 background box with border
   - Paragraphs: Clean typography with proper line spacing
   - Fully responsive Tailwind styling

3. **Accessibility Features**:
   - Semantic HTML: `<ul role="list">` for lists
   - Proper ARIA attributes: `aria-hidden` for decorative bullets
   - WCAG AA compliant color contrast (blue-600 on white, gray-700 on white)
   - Responsive text sizing and spacing

4. **Testing Results**:
   - All 16 parser tests passing
   - Build successful
   - Linting clean
   - Ready for visual QA with dev server running

**Technical Notes:**
- Parser prioritizes dollar amounts over kWh for metric detection (more relevant for savings)
- Graceful degradation: Falls back to plain text if parsing fails
- No breaking changes to existing data flow or API

### File List

**Created:**
- /src/worker/lib/narrative-parser.ts (parser implementation)
- /test/narrative-parser.spec.ts (comprehensive tests - 16 test cases)

**Modified:**
- /src/ui/components/results/RecommendationDeck.tsx (added FormattedNarrative component and rendering)
