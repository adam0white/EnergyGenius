# Epic 7 Notes:
# =============
# Three critical post-launch improvements based on user feedback:
# 1. Performance: Recommendation takes 45-60s, need to optimize Workers AI model (7.1)
# 2. UX: "Why" explanations need better formatting (7.2)
# 3. Progress: Timeline shows "success" at 10s but waits 50s more (7.3)
#
# Recommended execution order:
# 1. Start 7.1 (Model Performance) - longest, uses context7 MCP
# 2. Parallel: 7.2 (Why Formatting) - independent
# 3. Parallel: 7.3 (Progress Timing) - investigate immediately, conclusions after 7.1
# 4. Future: Exploratory testing with Playwright MCP
#
# Dependencies:
# - 7.1 and 7.2 are independent
# - 7.3 should start with investigation, but results depend on 7.1
# - All three together create significant UX improvement

# Timeline Estimate:
# 7.1: 2-3 days (research, benchmarking, optimization)
# 7.2: 1-2 days (parsing, UI update, testing)
# 7.3: 1 day (investigation, fix, validation)
# Total: 4-6 days for full epic
