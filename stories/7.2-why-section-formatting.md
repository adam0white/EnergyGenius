## User Story

As a user, I want the "Why" explanation for recommendations to be clearly formatted and easy to read, so that I can quickly understand the reasoning behind each recommendation without overwhelming text blocks.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Analyze Current "Why" Section

- [ ] Examine current recommendation response parsing in `/src/worker/ai/response-parsing.ts`
- [ ] Identify how "Why" sections are currently extracted from Claude response
- [ ] Review recommendation card component in `/src/ui/components/RecommendationCard.tsx`
- [ ] Determine current rendering method (single text block vs. formatted)
- [ ] Document findings in dev notes

### Parse "Why" Section Structure

- [ ] Create parser to identify natural structure in "Why" explanations:
  - [ ] Multi-paragraph sections (split by double line breaks)
  - [ ] Bullet point indicators (dash, asterisk, numbered)
  - [ ] Key insights or highlights (bold text patterns)
  - [ ] Impact statements or estimates
- [ ] Handle various Claude response formats:
  - [ ] Some explanations use numbered lists
  - [ ] Some use bullet points
  - [ ] Some use paragraph + nested explanation
  - [ ] Some are plain prose with implicit sections
- [ ] Create robust parser that doesn't break on edge cases
- [ ] Add parser function to `/src/worker/ai/response-parsing.ts`
- [ ] Unit test parser with 10+ example explanations

### Format & Present "Why" Section

- [ ] Design improved visual formatting:
  - [ ] Break text blocks into readable paragraphs
  - [ ] Convert bullet points to visual list items
  - [ ] Highlight key metrics or percentages
  - [ ] Use consistent spacing and indentation
  - [ ] Keep color scheme within existing design (Tailwind/shadcn)
- [ ] Update RecommendationCard component to:
  - [ ] Parse "Why" section using new parser
  - [ ] Render with improved formatting (not just text blob)
  - [ ] Display as styled list/paragraph sections if parsed
  - [ ] Fall back to text block if parsing fails
  - [ ] Maintain responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Ensure formatting works with various explanation lengths:
  - [ ] Short explanations (1-2 sentences)
  - [ ] Medium explanations (paragraph + insights)
  - [ ] Long explanations (multiple structured sections)

### Visual Design & Testing

- [ ] Create visual mockups of improved formatting:
  - [ ] How will bullets be styled?
  - [ ] How will paragraphs be spaced?
  - [ ] How will key metrics be highlighted?
  - [ ] Ensure Tailwind consistency
- [ ] Test with real recommendation responses:
  - [ ] Run app with sample recommendations
  - [ ] Verify "Why" sections render correctly
  - [ ] Test on desktop, tablet, mobile views
  - [ ] Check contrast and readability
  - [ ] Ensure no overflow or layout issues
- [ ] Get visual approval (compare before/after)
- [ ] Verify no accessibility regressions:
  - [ ] Color contrast passes WCAG AA
  - [ ] Semantic HTML for lists
  - [ ] Proper heading hierarchy if using headers

### Code & Documentation

- [ ] Add parser function to `/src/worker/ai/response-parsing.ts`:
  - [ ] Function to parse structured "Why" text
  - [ ] Return structured data (paragraphs, lists, metrics)
  - [ ] Thorough JSDoc comments
  - [ ] Error handling for malformed input
- [ ] Update `/src/ui/components/RecommendationCard.tsx`:
  - [ ] Import and use new parser
  - [ ] Render improved "Why" section format
  - [ ] Add TypeScript types for parsed structure
  - [ ] Add Tailwind classes for styling
  - [ ] Maintain responsive behavior
- [ ] Update `/src/ui/components/RecommendationCard.tsx` styles:
  - [ ] Add Tailwind utility classes
  - [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
  - [ ] Test with Tailwind's responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Update `/docs/architecture.md`:
  - [ ] Document "Why" section parsing strategy
  - [ ] Include examples of formatted output
  - [ ] Note any limitations or edge cases
- [ ] Commit with message: "Improve 'Why' section formatting in recommendations"

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze Current Implementation (AC: Analyze Current "Why" Section)
  - [ ] Review response parsing code
  - [ ] Review recommendation card component
  - [ ] Document current approach
- [ ] Create Parser (AC: Parse "Why" Section Structure)
  - [ ] Build parser function
  - [ ] Handle multiple response formats
  - [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Implement UI Formatting (AC: Format & Present "Why" Section)
  - [ ] Update RecommendationCard component
  - [ ] Implement responsive styling
  - [ ] Add fallback for parsing failures
- [ ] Visual Testing & Polish (AC: Visual Design & Testing)
  - [ ] Test with real recommendations
  - [ ] Test on all viewport sizes
  - [ ] Verify accessibility
  - [ ] Get visual approval
- [ ] Documentation & Commit (AC: Code & Documentation)
  - [ ] Add code documentation
  - [ ] Update architecture docs
  - [ ] Commit changes

## Dev Notes

- Current implementation likely renders the entire "Why" text as a single block
- Many Claude responses naturally structure explanations with line breaks and indicators
- Goal: Parse this natural structure and present it visually without breaking responsiveness
- The parser should be robust enough to handle multiple response formats from Claude
- Consider: Should we format on the worker (backend) or client (React component)?
  - Recommendation: Format on client for flexibility, but structure data on worker

### Project Structure Notes

- Response parsing: `/src/worker/ai/response-parsing.ts` [Source: story-5.3]
- Recommendation card: `/src/ui/components/RecommendationCard.tsx` [Source: story-5.3]
- Tailwind styling: Configured in `tailwind.config.js`
- Component styling approach: shadcn components with Tailwind
