## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I need to deploy the application to production via Cloudflare Workers, verify all endpoints work, set up monitoring, and document the deployment process, so that the application is live and accessible to users.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Deployment Execution

- [ ] Cloudflare Workers account configured with wrangler
- [ ] `wrangler auth` executed and authenticated
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
- [ ] `npm run deploy` executes successfully
- [ ] Deployment completes without errors or warnings
- [ ] Worker URL assigned and accessible
- [ ] Deployment logged with timestamp and version
- [ ] Rollback plan documented (in case of issues)

### Worker URL & SPA Loading

- [ ] GET request to Worker URL returns HTML (SPA loads)
- [ ] Browser loads SPA without JavaScript errors
- [ ] Page title visible in browser tab
- [ ] Header and footer render correctly
- [ ] Intake form visible and responsive
- [ ] No 404 errors on static assets
- [ ] CSS styling applied correctly (not plain HTML)
- [ ] JavaScript executed and interactive (form responds to input)

### API Endpoint Verification

- [ ] POST /api/recommend endpoint accessible from production URL
- [ ] API accepts valid intake request payload
- [ ] API returns recommendations array with 3+ items
- [ ] API response includes: title, description, savings projection
- [ ] API error handling works (returns proper error codes)
- [ ] CORS headers properly configured (no browser CORS errors)
- [ ] Request headers sent correctly (Content-Type: application/json)
- [ ] Response payload valid JSON (parses without error)

### Mock Data & Testing

- [ ] Mock data button functional in production
- [ ] Mock data button populates form with test scenario
- [ ] Mock data submission returns realistic recommendations
- [ ] Mock data doesn't affect real data (if any future tracking)
- [ ] Mock data button disabled in production (optional hardening)

### Error Handling in Production

- [ ] API timeout returns graceful error message
- [ ] Network errors handled without crashing SPA
- [ ] Invalid request returns 400 with error message
- [ ] Server errors (5xx) handled gracefully
- [ ] Retry mechanism works in production
- [ ] Error messages clear and non-technical to end user
- [ ] Error logging captures all failures for troubleshooting

### Monitoring & Logging

- [ ] `wrangler tail` command streams logs from production
- [ ] API requests logged with timestamp and method
- [ ] API responses logged with status code and duration
- [ ] Errors logged with stack trace and context
- [ ] Stage completion times logged (Queued, Running, Complete)
- [ ] Log messages readable and useful for debugging
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs (no API keys, personal data)
- [ ] Logs retained for at least 24 hours (Cloudflare default)

### Performance in Production

- [ ] API response time measured and logged (target < 20s)
- [ ] Page load time from production URL acceptable
- [ ] No unexpected slowness vs. local dev
- [ ] Database/AI model latency reasonable
- [ ] Worker CPU time within limits
- [ ] Worker memory usage stable

### Worker Configuration

- [ ] wrangler.toml properly configured with name, route, zone
- [ ] Environment variables set (API keys, config, if applicable)
- [ ] .env.production file not committed to git (secrets)
- [ ] Cloudflare API token stored securely (not in repo)
- [ ] Worker script optimized for Cloudflare platform
- [ ] No build artifacts committed to git (dist/, build/)

### Accessibility & Security in Production

- [ ] HTTPS enforced (Cloudflare default)
- [ ] SSL certificate valid and not expired
- [ ] No mixed HTTP/HTTPS content (no warnings)
- [ ] Security headers sent (if applicable: CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] No sensitive information in URL or logs
- [ ] User data not persisted without consent

### DNS & Domain Setup (Optional)

- [ ] If custom domain: DNS records configured
- [ ] If custom domain: A record points to Cloudflare
- [ ] If custom domain: SSL certificate issued (Cloudflare)
- [ ] If custom domain: redirects www to non-www (or vice versa)
- [ ] If custom domain: URL accessible without errors

### Rollback Plan

- [ ] Previous worker version can be rolled back (via wrangler)
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] If issues arise: can quickly revert to last stable version
- [ ] Version tags created in git (e.g., v1.0.0)
- [ ] Deployment history tracked in git commits

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Deployed URL accessible globally (no IP restrictions)
- [ ] 3 complete end-to-end flows work in production
- [ ] All 3 scenario types (residential, business, seasonal) tested
- [ ] No 5xx errors in production logs
- [ ] API latency acceptable (< 25 seconds)
- [ ] Page loads in < 3 seconds from deployed URL
- [ ] Form validation works in production
- [ ] Error retry works in production
- [ ] "Start Over" works in production

## Implementation Details

### Deployment Steps

1. Ensure all code is committed to git
2. Run `npm run build` locally and verify success
3. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare Workers
4. Note the Worker URL provided by wrangler
5. Test Worker URL in browser (GET request)
6. Test API endpoint with curl or Postman
7. Stream logs: `wrangler tail` and submit test request
8. Verify logs show request, processing, and response
9. Document deployment details in README

### Testing in Production

```bash
# Test SPA loads
curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/

# Test API endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"usage":800,"type":"residential","location":"CA"}'

# Stream logs
wrangler tail
```

### Monitoring Setup

- Use `wrangler tail` to monitor real-time logs
- Check Cloudflare dashboard for Worker analytics
- Monitor API response times for performance degradation
- Set up alerts for 5xx errors (optional)

### Rollback Procedure

- If issues discovered: revert git to previous commit
- Rebuild and redeploy: `npm run deploy`
- Or manually select previous worker version in Cloudflare dashboard
- Estimated rollback time: 2-5 minutes
